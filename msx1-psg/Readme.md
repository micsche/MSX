# MSX Sound card 
(untested)

The soundcard uses stock YM2149 (AY-3-8910 clone)
The MSX also uses this chip to interface to the joysticks. This version of the board does not include joystick ports (scope for Future Work).

The sound is fed into the BUS pin J3-8. However, the board has enough space to include a small-speaker. (scope for Future Work)
